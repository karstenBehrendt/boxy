# Boxy
Code for the Boxy vehicle dataset. The dataset and more information is available at https://boxy-dataset.com

All contributions are welcome, e.g. sample scripts in different machine learning frameworks.  You can even change the [website's code](https://github.com/karstenBehrendt/benchmarks_website/tree/master/benchmarks/boxy).

Feel free to create new issues within this repo for questions or shoot me an email. I'll probably take some time to help if there is a chance that it'll yield a citation. :) (Please make sure to search and verify your problems for a few minutes first.)
